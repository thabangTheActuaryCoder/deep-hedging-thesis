    \caption{Architecture of the LSTM-5 hedger ($\mathrm{NN}_1$).
    The full feature sequence $\mathbf{X}_{0:N}$ is first projected by
    a pre-MLP, then processed by a 5-layer stacked LSTM with 128~hidden units
    and dropout between layers. A head MLP maps the LSTM output at each step
    to hedge ratios $\Delta_k^{(1)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\mathrm{traded}}}$.
    Recurrent hidden and cell states $(h_t, c_t)$ carry temporal information
    across time steps.}
